# Test domain specific rules

This example project shows how to enforce coding rules which are domain specific.

The rule tested is as follows:
- Every class implementing the interface `MyInterface` must be annotated with  `@MandatoryAnnotation`

## Try it yourself

- Run the test
- Go to the class `ExampleClassRequiresAnnotation`
- Comment in the annotation
- Run the test again

## Motivation for this project
